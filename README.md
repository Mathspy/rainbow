# Rainbows!

This is my experimental library/project where I attempt to tinker with Rust every night for few hours with the end goal of becoming a Rustacean! No but really the goal is to learn Rust since most of my experience throughout the years have been with higher level languages and I wanna touch the *bare metals* a little bit and I just <span style="color: red">**love**</span> Rust.

About 1+ years ago (from today) I decided to spent next few nights reading about Rust, and I did just that, read what was completed out of Second Edition of The Rust Book at the time. I learnt a lot, understood most of it pretty well but didn't attempt experimenting much at the time. I forgot many things but they are coming back to me with each new line of code!
